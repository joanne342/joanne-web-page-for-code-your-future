<h1>Propellerheads Rebirth</h1>

<p>Propellerheads Rebirth emulates three classic Roland synths:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TB-303 bass synth</li>
  <li>TR-808 drum machine</li>
  <li>TR-909 drum machine</li>
</ul>

<p>It features the same step programming as the originals but also has its own sequencer so you can record your actions into songs. The software is very old but was pivotal in creating realistic soft synth copies of specific hardware and inspired many realistic soft synth copies of hardware in the following years, including Roland's own soft-synth 303, 707, and 808 versions in 2015.</p>

  <li>2010 - Released as an iOS app</li>
  <li>2017 - iOS app discontinued because of Roland copyright claim</li>
